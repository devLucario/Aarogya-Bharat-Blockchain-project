# Aarogya-Bharat-Blockchain-project
A web3 project using blockchain to store the patients medical history on cloud.

This project uses Tezos crypto blockchain to store the patients medical history in a secure way. This project has two applications:-
  1.) For hospitals, to register themselves and their doctors on the framework and see the patient's medical history only after the patient's consent.
  2.) For patients, to view and find any medical report of diagnosis or lab reports online and to be able to walk into any hospital without carrying the medical files or records.
